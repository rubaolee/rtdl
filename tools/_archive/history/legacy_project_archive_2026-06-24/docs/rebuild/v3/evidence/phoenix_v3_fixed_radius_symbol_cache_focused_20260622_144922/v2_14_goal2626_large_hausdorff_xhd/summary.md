# Goal2626 Embree vs OptiX Baseline

This artifact is an internal baseline for evaluating a future Triton/Numba partner path without new C++.
It is not a public speedup claim.

## Ratios

| App | Group | Embree sec | OptiX sec | OptiX speedup vs Embree | Metric source |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| hausdorff_xhd | hausdorff_threshold_decision | 0.572804 | 0.28224 | 2.03x | {"embree": "run_phases.query_fixed_radius_threshold_reached_count_sec", "optix": "run_phases.query_fixed_radius_threshold_reached_count_sec"} |

## Case Results

| App | Case | Backend | Status | Primary sec | Source or reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| hausdorff_xhd | hausdorff_embree_threshold | embree | ok | 0.572804 | run_phases.query_fixed_radius_threshold_reached_count_sec |
| hausdorff_xhd | hausdorff_optix_threshold | optix | ok | 0.28224 | run_phases.query_fixed_radius_threshold_reached_count_sec |

## Boundary

- Unsupported Embree rows are recorded as runtime coverage gaps, not failures of the app.
- `process_wall_median_sec` includes Python process startup and is weaker than app-internal timing.
- Rows with different comparison groups are not ratioed.
- Use these numbers as before/after baselines for the next partner path; do not use them as broad public claims without review.
