# Goal1366 v1.5 Inventory Remaining-Work Boundary

Date: 2026-05-06

## Scope

Made remaining app-specific work explicit in v1.5 migration inventory
boundaries.

## Implementation

- Updated inventory rows with non-empty `remaining_app_specific_work` so their
  `boundary` text names the remaining app-specific continuations.
- Extended `_validate_v1_5_generic_migration_inventory_rows()` to reject rows
  that hide or omit remaining work from the boundary.
- Added tests for valid boundary text and malformed remaining-work boundaries.

## Boundary

This is inventory metadata hardening only. It does not mark remaining
app-specific continuations as generic, authorize public speedup wording,
authorize public v1.5 release wording, or change the v1.0 release tag.
